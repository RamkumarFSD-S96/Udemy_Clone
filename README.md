**Udemy Clone Website Description**  

This project is a **Udemy Clone website** designed to replicate the layout and functionality of a modern online learning platform. It incorporates **HTML**, **CSS styles**, and **Flexbox** to achieve a clean and responsive design. Below are the key highlights of the website:  

1. **HTML Structure:**  
   - The website is structured with semantic HTML tags for clarity and accessibility.  
   - Key sections include:  
     - **Header:** Contains a logo, navigation links, and a search bar.

     - **Image:** A thumbnail to represent the course.  
     - **Title:** A clear and concise course name.  
     - **Description/Rating:** Brief details or star ratings for the course.  
     - **Enroll Button:** A call-to-action button encouraging users to enroll.  

5. **Responsive Design:**
